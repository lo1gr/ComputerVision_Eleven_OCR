# Eleven_Seven_Segment_OCR
This repo contains the data, model and development of a project I did in the context of my Msc with my colleagues for Eleven Strategy. We were tasked to develop a program for number recognition on images of fuel consumption. We combined computer vision (for digit detection) and deep learning (for number recognition) methods to obtain such a program.
